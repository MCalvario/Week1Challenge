# Week1Challenge


## Description

As a web developer, I want to refactor a website with a code base that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.  I was able to do this by replacing all div tags with semantics in the HTML flie.  In doing so, I learned that I also needed to make a couple of changes to the CSS file in order for my HTML changes to work.  I have followed the acceptance criteria below.


## Acceptance Criteria

When I view the source code
Then I find the semantic HTML elements
When I view the structure of the HTML elements
Then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
When I view the image elements
Then I find accessible alt attributes
When I view the heading attributes
Then they fall in sequential order
When I view the title element
Then I find a concise, descriptive title
